DESCRIPTION

     pawl is a front-end to HandBrake which may be used to quickly convert
     your DVD collection into lightweight files.  More specifically
     H.264/MPEG-4 AVC encoded video, a variety of audio formats (including
     ac3, dts, and vorbis), in an mkv container.

STORY

     I wrote this for the purpose of near-lossless conversion of my DVD
     collection so I may keep them in the closet, yet still have films
     immediately accessible.  I live in a small apartment and did not want
     to have media piling up everywhere.  Pawl is specifically designed to
     work with my personal workflow, I feel it could be equally useful to
     others in a similar situation.
